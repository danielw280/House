The device sits in two hands comfortably.  One handle in each hand with an area in the middle that connects the two.  Forest green and black dominate the the color scheme.  Four colorful buttons are on the right side, one blue, one red, one green, and one yellow.  The center holds a circular button with an X on it, reflecting white light.  A directional pad is on the left side as well as two offset joysticks on each side.  The back contains a trigger as well as a bumper, each on both sides too.  A headphone jack is on the bottom where auxiliary chords can be attached.  The device accepts a couple kinds of data.  The main type is the button input data.  If any of the many buttons or triggers are pressed this action is accepted and processed in the device.  The other type is the auxiliary input.  This is in the form of sound which is transferred through a microphone and also processed in the device.  The device processes the inputs by converting the specific action into binary code so it can be understood by the motherboard.  The result of this processing is then sent wirelessly to the mother device which continues to process and output the data
