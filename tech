This technology is called Fiberoptic internet.  This product is able to bring information from datacenters to another device in a very short time.  To use this technology all one needs is the ability to access the internet.  Anything that needs to download or stream over wifi has the possibility of using fiberoptic internet.  The fiberoptic part is just the material used to transfer photons which contain the data requested by machines.  The common measure of performance is often in MB/second but can range from KB to GB.  Fiber Optic internet speeds are reported to be much faster than the regular copper wire, so on days when the speeds are normal, the speed shouldn't ever drop to KB/second.  Recent news about this product is only positive.  Articles call for fiberoptic internet to be accessable to all people, mostly in rural areas where dsl or satellite internet are the only options.  The only change for this product based on news would be an increase in sales.  Since it's the fastest of its type, the more people that hear about it, the more they want it.  Fiber Optic wires replace the older and slower versions of copper wire or the even slower satellite reception.  For me, my town has only been able ot use copper wire.  This has curbed the download speed down to .5-1 mb/sec.  Streaming is almost impossible and research is difficult when it takes minutes to load web pages.  Now that I have experienced slow internet, when my town gets fiberoptic next year the possibilities will be unfathomable.  For society at large, fiber optic has had a positive impact.  With faster connection speed, poeple can stay in touch and learn faster than ever.
